## Introduction

<img src="./misc/readme/ethereum-explorer-demo.gif"  />

This project is an easy-to-use Ethereum explorer application designed to help users search and view detailed information about an address.

The primary purpose of this app is to provide a simple interface for users to:
-   Search for Ethereum addresses.
-   View balances, token holdings, and NFTs.
-   Access transaction history with comprehensive details.
- Switch to dark/light/system theme


## Tech stack

This application is built using **TypeScript**, **React**, **Next.js (App Router)**, **Tailwind CSS**, **shadcn** and the [Chainbase API](https://chainbase.com/).

The main motivation behind choosing this tech stack was to experiment with the app router and server components in Next.js. Tailwind CSS and ShadCN were selected for their ease of use and ability to quickly create good looking and responsive UI. And Chainbase because the API is the best fit to quickly implement the decided features.
